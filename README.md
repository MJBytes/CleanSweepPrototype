What the project does?

Clean Sweep is an app that will plan cleaning schedules for users based on how long ago it was done and how often a cleaning activity needs to be done. 

Why is the project worthwhile?

The idea of Clean Sweep is to remove the burden of remembering to do certain jobs, like washing the window in the upstairs bedroom or unpacking the fridge before the food in the back goes rotten. Often, we feel overwhelmed with so much on our plates, but if we can create a system, we can help people.

How users can get started with the project?

Users can create a log in. After Creating a login, users should be able to access their profiles, where they can start adding rooms and jobs.
